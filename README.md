# Temperature-And-Humidity-Measure-With-STM32F1-Microcontroller

The Microcontroller Unit (MCU) is a critical component of embedded system architecture. The STM32 microcontroller offers one of the best ecosystems, supporting various programmer kits and peripherals such as sensors, displays, and keypads to operate simultaneously. For our embedded system project that detects temperature and humidity, we will utilize the STM32 along with its peripherals. Specifically, we have selected the STM32F103C8T6 - Blue Pill as the primary MCU. Instead of an LCD module, we will use an I2C OLED display, along with the temperature and humidity sensors and a buzzer with red LED. Connections will be made using the jumper wires and a breadboard. STM32CubeIDE will be used for programming the system and ST Link V2 will be used to inject that programming code onto the microcontroller.
